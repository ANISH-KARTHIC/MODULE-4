# ðŸ§© Module 4: Guessing Game with Loops (`while`)

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Module Matters  
- Introduces repetition using `while` loops  
- Allows the game to continue until the correct guess is made  
- Reinforces the concept of conditions controlling flow over time  
- Helps students understand how to build interactive, ongoing programs

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New in This Module  
- Adds a `while` loop to keep asking for guesses until the correct one is entered  
- Students learn how to maintain and exit a loop using conditions  
- Enables a complete gameplay loop with retry attempts

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Introduced  
- **`while` loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains true  
- **Loop Control**: How to start, maintain, and stop a loop  
- **Game Loop**: A core pattern in many interactive programs where user input and feedback repeat until a condition is met
